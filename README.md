LED_Stick
=========

The LED Stick contains eight white LEDs and an AS1109 8-Bit LED driver, which allows you to control the states of all the LEDs with just two data pins from a microcontroller.  Eagle files for the board are provided here, as are an Arduino sketch and a Processing based graphical user interface for selecting and displaying custom flash patterns.
